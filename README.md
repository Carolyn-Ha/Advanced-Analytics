## Projects
- **Telemarketing Customer Targeting Using KMeans Clustering and Predictive Models**: Data was collected and analyzed to identify individuals most likely to be interested in purchasing the product. First, a KMeans clustering model was applied to segment the data into clusters, revealing patterns and relationships within the population. Next, a KNN model estimated the association between independent variables and a continuous outcome by averaging observations within similar groups. Finally, an ANN model was developed to predict the likelihood of callers making a purchase, using neural pathways to learn from the data and generate informed predictions.
- **Hotel Cancellation Prediction Using Stacked Algorithms**: A stacked model was used to predict hotel cancellations. In the first level, models like Logistic Regression, KNN, ANN, and SVM were applied, with optimizations such as feature selection, parameter tuning, and testing various configurations (e.g., k-values, kernels, neuron settings). For the second-level model, a Decision Tree was built, emphasizing a reduction in false negatives due to the higher associated cost. Metrics like false negatives, false positives, kappa, and accuracy were analyzed to fine-tune the model for cost-effectiveness.
- **Credit card application appproval prediction**: To analyze and predict factors influencing credit card application approval, a second-level predictive model and an R-Shiny dashboard for customer access were created. Given the limited size of the data, the data is cross-validated 4 times to ensure that as much information can be extracted as possible. With the data, a logistic regression, KNN, ANN, SVM, and decision tree model are built at the first level. These are then combined into one stack model which is then used at the second level to build a second level decision tree to most accurately predict credit card approval status. Confusion matrices are created for each model as well to determine model efficacy as well as false negative and false positive rates.
